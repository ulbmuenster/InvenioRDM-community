## Session title: Community engagement and handling pull requests

**Time slot:**
Tuesday, 10.30 - 12.00

**Room:**
R5/6

**Host:**
Sarah

**Participants:**


### Problem statement
No bandwidth
- nobody in the room is paid to build inveniordm product
- people are paid for a service to users (new features)
- xenodo is the thing, is getting people paid (funding) and is putting pressure on resources

overview/knowledge issue (what is here)
- architecture is complex
- quality control is a difficult decision
- there are a lot of dependencies

We don't leverage enough from the community.
The community should be engaged into what CERN and others are doing in the long run

### Ideas shared
- specify criticality
- (worked in the past) people get organized beforehand and push software in a coordinated way
- release manager (who pays)
- have upfront discussions with mockups and community feedback
- think about user experience
- plan features
- community board, 3 roles (reviewer, contributor, coordinator)
- identify the people who can review PRs (inside CERN and outside CERN)
- CERN should communicate on their roadmap so that contributor are aware
- ease the level of information on risk associated to PRs
- community (beyond CERN) should be able to accompany contributors 
- find new sources of funding (use community money?) => European projects
- community can paticipate to already funded developments
- identify expertize in the community
- time boxing PR review work with CERN and the community (one week every 2 month)
- give merge rights on old versions to people running them
- give merge rights on some specific topics (translations for instance)
- more strict PR triage and checklist before review for big PRs
- talk before starting a big features
- different review levels (cosmetic up to architecture)


### Actions decided
- document this process in invenio-docs (curator role, responsibilities, templates, schedule, reviewer guide)
- PR checklist more extensive (criticality, bug/feature, packages impacted, target release (old, current, new brach))
- merge party this afternoon and at a regular fashion
- dream parties (form pitch to architecture proposal, mockups)
- demo parties
- public documentation of people to talk to for packages and features
- dedicated role for community contribution management
- identify people involved from the community and their involvement
