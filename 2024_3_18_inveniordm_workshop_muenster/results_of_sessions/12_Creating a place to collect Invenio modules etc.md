### Problem statement
There's no one place to collect developments, overlays, extensions and other developments related to InvenioRDM.

### Ideas shared
There's curated "Awesome" link lists on GitHub for multiple projects (Awesome PHP and Awesome Python are pretty well known), it would be nice to have something for InvenioRDM.

### Actions decided

- move to **https://inveniosoftware.github.io/awesome-invenio/** - it lives there with a link to the actual GitHub Repository where everyone with a GitHub-Account can add their or other projects and create a PR for it. It's mainly curated by @egabancho for the time being.
