### Problem statement
In this discussion, we propose to establish an efficient process for consistently updating and maintaining the internal roadmap of InvenioRDM. We want to design a structured workflow that ensures timely integration of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes into the roadmap. Ensuring the internal roadmap remains up-to-date will improve transparency in the development process for community partners. (See: https://github.com/orgs/inveniosoftware/projects/80/views/1)
This project could also establish clear guidelines and mechanisms for evaluating, prioritizing, and integrating feedback from stakeholders.

### Ideas shared
1.	Will still not list exact dates/deadlines when features & versions will be released
2.	We will implement GitHub Discussions as our new feature request forum
3.	Requests will be mapped to the existing issues in the roadmap and will be assigned a category based on a homegrown, constantly maintained list (already in use in the Roadmap)
4.	CERN will do quarterly cleaning & updates on this (Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct), and will report at the corresponding telecon. Weâ€™ll encourage the community to submit their requests in time for this, and the telecon can give us an opportunity to talk out misunderstandings and get things aligned. Thus the steps in the process become:
    a.	Ideas/feature requests are discussed in telecon, can followup via email
 	b. InvenioRDM partners open an issue for tasks they are working on, or planning to work on in the near future (i.e. have assigned resources to)
 	c. The issue is added to roadmap project board.
    
5.	When an Issue is assigned by CERN, it will track:
* a responsible person (assignee)
* the partner organisation(s) participating
* the targeted release
* requirements (motivation, user stories)
* technical design documents (mockups, data model, REST APIs, programmatic API etc)

6.	Add an idea to GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/discussions/new?category=ideas 


### Actions decided
1. GitHub Discussions implemented for feature request forum: https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/discussions/new?category=ideas 
2. CERN will do quarterly cleaning & updates of roadmap items (Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct) and will host talks about issues at corresponding telecons
