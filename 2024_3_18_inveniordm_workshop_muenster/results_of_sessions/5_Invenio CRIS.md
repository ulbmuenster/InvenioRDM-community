### Actions we decided to take:
- further call for interest in InvenioRDM visio conferences (presentation)
- Created a GitHub Discussion to gather more use case and interest from the commmunity https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/discussions/153
- decide between specific in communities and more ambitious in a specific module based on traction
- If invenio-communities is the way to go, try to put specific fields in community data model in a bucketed way
- deepen code review
