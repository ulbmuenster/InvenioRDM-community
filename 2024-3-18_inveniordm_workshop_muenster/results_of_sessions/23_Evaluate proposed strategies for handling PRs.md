### Problem statement

Follow up for "[Handling pull requests](https://pad.uni-muenster.de/BhpiCtKTS-Kck-0kP5PaZw?both)" on Tuesday

On Tuesday we collected some ideas on how to improve PR handling. Participants had the opportunity to vote on their favorites during the last days. Now we need to evaluate how we can put the most popular approaches into action in the future.

### Ideas shared

### Actions decided

- regular merge parties right after Telecons (cut Telecons to 30 minutes) (Sara)
- train more people as maintainers with merge rights (in on-site meetings) (CERN)
- figure out a clear labelling system (Karolina)
